When_adversity_knocks=["""Asha was getting frustrated and tired of life, so she asked her father what to do. Her father told her to bring an egg, two tea leaves, and a potato.
    He then brought out three vessels, filled them with water, and placed them on the stove.
    Once the water was boiling, he told Asha to place the items into each pot and keep an eye on them. After 10 minutes,
    he asked Asha to peel the egg, peel the potato, and strain the leaves. Asha was left confused.
    Her father explained, “Each item was placed into the same circumstance, boiling water. See how each responded differently?”
    He continued, “The egg was soft, but is now hard. The potato was hard, but is now soft. And the tea leaves, they changed the water itself.”
    The father then asked, “When adversity calls, we respond in the same manner as they have. Now, are you an egg, a potato, or tea leaves?”"""]
Glass_of_milk=["""There once was a poor boy who spent his days going door-to-door selling newspapers to pay for school. One day, as he was walking his route,
    he started feeling low and weak. The poor boy was starving, so he decided to ask for food when he came to the next door.
    The poor boy asked for food but was denied every time, until he reached the door of a girl. He asked for a glass of water, but seeing his poor state,
    the girl came back with a glass of milk. The boy asked how much he owed her for the milk, but she refused payment.
    Years later, the girl, who was now a grown woman, fell sick. She went from doctor to doctor, but no one was able to cure her. Finally, she went to the best doctor in town.
    The doctor spent months treating her until she was finally cured. Despite her happiness, she was afraid she couldn’t afford to pay the bill.
    But, when the hospital handed her the bill, it read, ‘Paid in full, with a glass of milk.’"""]
Ants_and_the_grosshoper=["""One bright autumn day, a family of ants was busy working in the warm sunshine.
    They were drying out the grain they had stored up during the summer when a starving grasshopper came up. With his fiddle under his arm,
    the grasshopper humbly begged for a bite to eat.
    “What!” cried the ants, “Haven’t you stored any food away for the winter? What in the world were you doing all summer?”
    “I didn’t have time to store any food before winter,” the grasshopper whined. “I was too busy making music that the summer flew by.”
    The ants simply shrugged their shoulders and said, “Making music, were you? Very well, now dance!” The ants then turned their backs on the grasshopper and returned to work."""]
The_golden_touch=["""There once was a king named Midas who did a good deed for a Satyr. And he was then granted a wish by Dionysus, the god of wine.
    For his wish, Midas asked that whatever he touched would turn to gold. Despite Dionysus’ efforts to prevent it,
    Midas pleaded that this was a fantastic wish, and so, it was bestowed.
    Excited about his newly-earned powers, Midas started touching all kinds of things, turning each item into pure gold.
    But soon, Midas became hungry. As he picked up a piece of food, he found he couldn’t eat it. It had turned to gold in his hand.
    Hungry, Midas groaned, “I’ll starve! Perhaps this was not such an excellent wish after all!”
    Seeing his dismay, Midas’ beloved daughter threw her arms around him to comfort him, and she, too, turned to gold. “The golden touch is no blessing,” Midas cried."""]
The_golden_duck=["""Once upon a time, a farmer had a goose that laid one golden egg every day. The egg provided enough money for the farmer and his wife to support
    their daily needs. The farmer and his wife continued to be happy for a long time.
    But, one day, the farmer thought to himself, “Why should we take just one egg a day? Why can’t we take them all at once and make a lot of money?”
    The farmer told his wife his idea, and she foolishly agreed.
    Then, the next day, as the goose laid its golden egg, the farmer was quick with a sharp knife. He killed the goose and cut its stomach open,
    in the hopes of finding all its golden eggs. But, as he opened the stomach, the only thing he found was guts and blood.
    The farmer quickly realized his foolish mistake and proceeded to cry over his lost resource.
    As the days went on, the farmer and his wife became poorer and poorer. How jinxed and how foolish they were."""]
